# unity-tbrpg-realtime-arena
Realtime multiplayer game mode for Turnbase RPG template

## Development plan
- Uses [Colyseus](https://www.colyseus.io/) for room creation, match making, and turnbase battle
- For the early access version, it will not have match making yet (no button which press then random player to battle) but it will have room creation, room list and joining.
- ~~Add room list, room creation and joining UIs~~
- ~~Implement realtime battle~~
- Develop match making system after realtime battle is implemented
- Add match making UIs

## Workflow
- Players start match making with ID and token as a payload
- Server read the payload then validate user and bring formation data from game service (so the game service must have functions to get formation and other data)
- Server create a room after players matched, then send room ID to clients
- Clients join the room by recieved room ID
- Clients tells server that the battle scene is loaded and ready to play
- Server random and set game-manager client
- Game start, game-manager client will find the first turn is for the client who own character which has highest speed stats
- Player has a few time to decision to attack or use skills
- When player decided, game-manager client will simulate character action and broadcast result to all clients
- When any side leave the game all characters from that side will random an actions
- When the battle end, server may tell game-service to record it for rewarding later

## Getting Started
- Setup [the server](https://github.com/insthync/tbrpg-realtime-arena-server)
- Add `Scenes/Lobby`, `Scenes/LoginScene(RealtimeArena)`, `ManageScene(RealtimeArena)` and `OnlineBattleScene` to `Scenes In Build` settings, set `Scenes/LoginScene(RealtimeArena)` as a first scene
- You can change server URL in `Scenes/Lobby` -> `Realtime Arena Manager` component
